# 📂 Absolute Prerequisite for Learning DevOps

## Overview
Before mastering technical tools like Docker or Kubernetes, a DevOps Engineer must understand the **organizational ecosystem**. This phase of learning focuses on how business requirements evolve into technical tasks and the professional frameworks (Agile/Scrum) that dictate our daily work.

## 🏛️ Organizational Roles & The Requirement Ladder
In a corporate environment, a DevOps engineer works within a chain of command. Understanding who provides the requirements is essential for successful delivery.



| Role | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Customer** 👤 | Identifies the business need or problem to be solved. |
| **Business Analyst (BA)** 📊 | Translates customer needs into a **Business Requirement Document (BRD)**. |
| **Product Manager (PM)** 📋 | Defines the high-level roadmap and feature prioritization. |
| **Product Owner (PO)** 🛠️ | Breaks the roadmap into **Epics** and manages the team's backlog. |
| **Solutions Architect** 🏗️ | Creates the technical blueprint (HLD/LLD) and verifies feasibility. |
| **Scrum Team** 👥 | A cross-functional group (Dev, DevOps, QA, DBA) that executes the work. |

## 🔄 The Lifecycle of a DevOps Task
Technical work doesn't appear out of thin air. It follows a structured breakdown:

1.  **The Epic**: A large, high-level objective (e.g., "Enable Global Payments").
2.  **The User Story**: A smaller, functional requirement (e.g., "As a user, I want to pay via UPI").
3.  **The Task**: The actual technical work assigned to you (e.g., *"Provision AWS RDS instance for Payment Service"*).

## ⏱️ Agile & Scrum: Our Operating System
Most DevOps teams operate using **Agile Methodology**, specifically the **Scrum Framework**. This allows for iterative progress rather than waiting for a single "big bang" release.

* **Sprints**: 2–3 week cycles of focused work.
* **Daily Stand-ups**: 15-minute syncs to discuss progress and "blockers."
* **Sprint Planning**: Deciding which tasks from the backlog will be completed in the next sprint.
* **Retrospectives**: Analyzing what went well and what failed to improve the next cycle.

## 🛠️ Jira: The Source of Truth
**Jira** is the primary tool used to track these tasks. For a DevOps Engineer, Jira is critical because:
* **Visibility**: It proves the value of your work to management.
* **Dependencies**: It shows if a developer is waiting on you for infrastructure.
* **Documentation**: It keeps a history of why certain technical decisions were made.

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways
* **Collaboration is Mandatory**: DevOps is about breaking silos. You must speak the language of both the Business (PM/PO) and the Technical (Dev/QA) teams.
* **No Jira = No Work**: If a task isn't tracked in a project management tool, it is invisible to the organization.
* **Context over Code**: Understanding the *Business Goal* helps you build better, more resilient infrastructure.
